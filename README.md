[![Waffle.io - Issues in progress](https://badge.waffle.io/clirdlf/digitization_cost_calculator.svg?label=in%20progress&title=In%20Progress)](http://waffle.io/clirdlf/digitization_cost_calculator)

A tool based on donated statistics that helps organizations better estimate the time and other costs related to digitization projects.

## Installation

## Quickstart

### Windows

Windows requires a few additional requirements that you will need to install:

- [Atom](https://atom.io/) - A much nicer text editor than Notepad...
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - We need this for the git-bash client
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - For running a local web server
- [RailsInstaller](http://railsinstaller.org/) - For generating the JavaScript dataset
- [GitHubDesktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - For version control/publishing the website
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com) - An account on GitHub

After installation of these, you'll need to "clone" the repository. You can do so by clicking on the green "Clone or Download" button on the [project page](https://github.com/clirdlf/digitization_cost_calculator).

It doesn't matter where you save it, but you'll need to remember where it is. I always set my project location to `C:/Users/%user%/projects/`. Again, just remember where you save it to.

Make sure the branch says `gh-pages`.

In the GitHub Client, right click on the `digitization_cost_calculator` project and select "Open in Terminal".

In this terminal session, type:

```
npm install
bundle
```

After this is finished installing everything, in the terminal type `gulp`. This will start a webserver on you machine and open your browser to the page [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Whenever you save a file, this will rebuild the site and refresh you page so you should see your update immediately.

To **stop** the webserver, hit `ctrl + c`.

#### Edit the Files

In the GitHub Client, right-click on the `digitization_cost_calculator` project and select **Open in Atom**. This should launch in Atom.

[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

#### Publishing Changes

After you've made changes, you should see a list of changes under the "Uncommitted Change" tab at the top of the GitHub Client. Add a **Summary** of the changes you made a brief **description** of what changed. Then click on the **Commit to gh-pages** button to publish the change.

This is important, you then need to **sync** these changes by clicking on the **Sync** button in the top-right.

### macOS

All of the commands are run through the terminal. You can make this a
nicer experience with [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) and
[bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it#install).

1.  Make a projects directory (`mkdir -p ~/projects`)
2.  Clone the repository to your computer (`cd ~/projects && git clone https://github.com/clirdlf/digitization_cost_calculator.git`)
3.  Change to the project directory (`cd ~/projects/digitization_cost_calculator`)
4.  Install the dependencies (`bundle && npm install`)
5.  Start the Jekyll server (`gulp`)
6.  Open the project in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (it should open automatically though)
7.  Celebrate :tada:
